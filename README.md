# Simon Says Game 

## Intro

When the game begins, a color will flash. Remember that color and select it. With each level you must remember the order of colors from the previous level to continue advancing. How good is your memory? Play and find out!

## Purpose 

The project was my first attempt at building a website using jQuery. In order to win the game the user must remember the sequence of colors and select the button in the right order. Using jquery allowed me to build the game with more efficient code. Each button is associated with a specific color and sound.
